# Introduction
Within our diverse trainee community, we recognized the unique challenges faced by individuals juggling multiple responsibilities, such as caring for children, which could hinder their ability to attend live sessions. Additionally, we acknowledged the varying preferences among learners, with some favouring the written word over auditory instruction, while others sought opportunities to review course content at their convenience.

Driven by a desire to create an inclusive and accessible learning environment, we identified the need for a platform that could host transcripts, enabling all trainees to engage with the course material in a manner that suited their circumstances and learning styles.

# Features
As a Mentor, one can upload SRT files and optionally generate summaries of the transcript content using an OpenAI key, which can then be made available for Trainees to view.

As a Trainee, one can access and read the transcripts, cast votes, and view each transcript's vote count and view count for each transcript.
